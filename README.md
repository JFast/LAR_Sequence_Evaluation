# Description of Source Files

## Auxiliary Source Files

### `EndoCam_Calibration.py`

Performs standard calibration of the MIT-LAR laryngoscope using a set of images of an asymmetrical circle grid. Uses identified distortion coefficients for undistortion of sample image. Returns result.

### `Parameters.py`

Contains preset parameter values for background model and stimulation droplet detection.

### `Preprocessing.py`

Contains auxiliary functions for frame preprocessing: contrast enhancement, channel/grayscale conversion, data type conversion, and filtering.

### `ReferencePoint.py`

Contains auxiliary functions required for the execution of a method proposed by Andrade-Miranda and Godino-Llorente ("ROI detection in high speed laryngeal images", 2014 IEEE 11th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging, 2014, pp. 477â€“480, DOI: [10.1109/ISBI.2014.6867912](https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2014.6867912)), which provides a glottal reference point to guide the subsequent glottis segmentation procedure.

### `Segmentation.py`

Contains auxiliary functions for the automatic estimation of the glottal contour (label/grid/seed point creation, watershed segmentation, region growing, edge detection, glottal midline orientation detection, etc.).

### `Fitting.py`

Contains functions for the analytical approximation of data points representing the temporal evolution of the glottal area and the vocal fold edge angle and distance using different model functions. Contains auxiliary functions for identification of relevant points (intersections, inflections, etc.), conversion between representations, iterative identification of linear segments of MIT-LAR stimulation droplet trajectories, calculation of derivatives, estimation of characteristical angular velocities, and RMSE/MAE calculation.

### `DisplayVideo.py`

Contains auxiliary functions for window handling, frame sequence input/output, and visualization of (intermediate) results of algorithm for automatic extraction of glottal parameters.

### `Plots.py`

Contains auxiliary functions for result visualization using diagrams.

## Main Algorithms

### `LAR_Stimulation_Detection.py`

Performs automatic localization and tracking of MIT-LAR stimulation droplet after background subtraction. Differentiates impact/rebound events. Searches for additional droplets. Returns results (frame sequences, text file containing result summary, image files).

### `LAR_Onset_Detection.py`

Performs automatic detection of glottal reference point and contour and attempts automatic correction of glottal midline orientation (strictly vertical orientation desired). Estimates temporal evolution of glottal area and vocal fold edge angle and distance over frame sequence. Performs analytical modeling of identified time courses using different fit functions. Returns results (frame sequences, text file containing result summary, plots, image files).
